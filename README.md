# CODEBOX_MOBILE_BOOTCAMP
I started this but after a while I realized I wouldn't be able to run the XCode natively as I am on windows, but hope to show some of my effort. 

## Supabase Setup
- Created project: `MobileTodoDB`
- Added table: `todos` (columns: id, task, is_done)
- Example Swift connection code included in `SupabaseExample.swift`
